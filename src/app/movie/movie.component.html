        <p>With this live-action remake of the beloved animation Beauty and the Beast, the studio tried to do the right thing. A gay character (played by Josh Gad) is introduced and Belle (Emma Watson) gets an injection of feminist sass. Unfortunately, Gad’s character LeFou is hardly the celebration of diversity one would hope for – he’s a prancing rainbow flag of a sidekick, defined by the comic potential of his sexuality rather than just his sexuality. And Belle, with her skirt tucked into her bloomers and her sniffy disdain for the “provincial life”, 
          might be a feminist but she’s also kind of a dick.</p>

          This is the most intense, complex, and stirring Marvel Cinematic Universe film yet -- though the sheer number of characters
           and storylines make it a bit confusing for anyone who's not a hard-core fan. Avengers: Infinity War is also the grimmest MCU movie so far,
            with consequences unlike any that have come before in this massive franchise. Much of the talk about the film will center on those events (no more details here, to avoid spoilers), but there's more to it than that. Directors Joe and Anthony Russo and
           screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely</p> </mat-card-content>

          "The Matrix" is a visually dazzling cyberadventure, full of kinetic excitement, but it retreats to formula just when it's getting interesting. It's kind of a letdown when a movie begins by redefining the nature of reality, and ends with a shoot-out. We want a leap of the imagination, not one of those obligatory climaxes with automatic weapons fire.
        
         I've seen dozens if not hundreds of these exercises in violence, which recycle the same tired ideas: Bad guys fire thousands of rounds,
          but are unable to hit the good guy. Then it's down to the final showdown between good and evil--a martial arts

          The remarkable thing about Mario Puzo’s novel was the way it seemed to be told from the inside out; he didn’t give us a world of international intrigue, but a private club as constricted as the seventh grade. Everybody knew everybody else and had a pretty shrewd hunch what they were up to.
          The movie (based on a script labored over for some time by Puzo and then finally given form, I suspect,
           by director Francis Ford Coppola) gets the same feel. We tend to identify with Don Corleone’s family 
           not because we dig gang wars, but because we have been with them from the beginning, watching them wait

          The screenplay, by Tarantino and Roger Avary, is so well-written in a scruffy, fanzine way that you want to rub noses in it
           - the noses of those zombie writers who take "screenwriting" classes that teach them the formulas for "hit films."
            Like "Citizen Kane," "Pulp Fiction" is constructed in such a nonlinear way that you could see it a dozen times and not
             be able to remember what comes next. It doubles back on itself, telling several interlocking stories about characters
              who inhabit a world of crime and intrigue, triple-crosses and loud desperation. The title is perfect. Like those old
